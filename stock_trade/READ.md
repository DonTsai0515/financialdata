## 股票爬蟲＆程式交易回測

### 股票爬蟲

* 利用網路爬蟲關注自己選股的邏輯，可以借用自動化縮減盤後的觀察時間，在上市櫃近1800家公司找到近期能操作的股票  
目前現階段是以自己以往選股的方式做漏斗篩選邏輯，目前以投信籌碼面為主，成交量、漲幅為輔  
未來希望能綜合更多面相...未完待續

### 程式交易回測

## Stock Web Scraping and Program Trading Backtesting　　

### Stock Web Scraping

* Using web scraping to follow my own logic of selecting stocks, one can use automation to reduce after-hours observation time and find tradable stocks among nearly 1800 listed and OTC companies in Taiwan Stock Market.  
Currently, the selection logic is based on the way I have selected stocks in the past, using a funnel screening process, where investment trust chip face is the primary factor, and trading volume and price increase are supplementary factors.  
In the future, I hope to integrate more aspects into the screening process... to be continued.

### Program Trading Backtesting

* P commonly used technical indicators in the market, such as RSI and Bollinger Bands, and backtesting the historical trading performance with entry and exit strategies.
